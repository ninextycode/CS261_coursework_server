According to studies, chicken isn't quite as 'good' for us as it once was, despite it being widely heralded as better for us than beef, lamb or pork.<br>A study last year by the University of Arkansas and Texas A&M concluded that “the severity of white striping has increased in recent years."<br>Scientists found white striping present in 96 per cent of the birds they tested (285 in total).<br>This white striping doesn't just mean more fat, but it also "negatively impacts meat quality," according to researchers.<br>Read More Also, a spokesman for the National Chicken Council told BuzzFeed that white striping only affects a “small percentage of chicken meat” and “does not create any health or food safety concerns for people and the welfare of the chicken itself is not negatively impacted.”<br>So look out for white striping and avoid it if you can.<br>Rated ZERO for food hygiene<br> (Summary created with sumy 0.7.0 library)

The North American Meat Institute, an industry lobby group, called the report “dramatic and alarmist overreach”.<br>Yet it is this very colour that we should be suspicious of, as the French journalist Guillaume Coudray explains in a book published in France last year called Cochonneries , a word that means both “piggeries” and “rubbish” or “junk food”.<br>In 1994, to take just one paper among hundreds on nitrosamines and cancer, two American epidemiologists found that eating hotdogs one or more times a week was associated with higher rates of childhood brain cancer, particularly for children who also had few vitamins in their diets.<br>The two experts at the National Cancer Institute told me that meats containing nitrites and nitrates have “consistently been associated with increased risk of colon cancer” in human studies.<br>The epidemiological data – based on surveys of what people eat – is now devastatingly clear that diets high in “processed meats” lead to a higher incidence of cancer.<br>It may be possible that epidemiologists have not asked people more detailed questions about what kind of processed meats they eat because they assume there is no mass-market alternative to bacon made without nitrates or nitrites.<br>In 2009, Juan de Dios Hernandez Canovas, a food scientist and the head of the food tech company Prosur, found that if he added certain fruit extracts to fresh pork, it stayed pink for a surprisingly long time.<br> (Summary created with sumy 0.7.0 library)

CC BY 2.0 Anthony Albright An investigation reveals shocking hygiene failings in major U.S. meat plants, heating up the controversy over an impending trade deal between the two countries.<br>A joint investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Guardian found numerous incidents of hygiene failings at major American meat-processing plants.<br>Diseased poultry meat that had been condemned found in containers used to hold edible food products; Pig carcasses piling up on the factory floor after an equipment breakdown, leading to contamination with grease, blood and other filth; Meat destined for the human food chain found riddled with faecal matter and abscesses filled with pus; High-power hoses being used to clean dirty floors next to working production lines containing food products; Factory floors flooded with dirty water after drains became blocked by meat parts and other debris; Dirty chicken, soiled with faeces or having been dropped on the floor, being put back on to the production line after being rinsed with dilute chlorine.<br>The Bureau and the Guardian conducted its investigation by reviewing previously unpublished documents relating to 47 meat plants across the U.S.<br>These included Pilgrim's Pride, one of the country's biggest chicken producers, and Swift Pork.<br>But many Britons are concerned about the low quality of U.S. meat and low hygiene standards, at least relative to British meat processing plants.<br>The problem is only going to get worse in the U.S., if pig slaughter times are sped up, as the industry plans to do .<br> (Summary created with sumy 0.7.0 library)
